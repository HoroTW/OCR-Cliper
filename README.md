# Screenshot through EasyOCR

This is just a very simple script that takes a image or the path to an image from the clipboard and 
runs it through EasyOCR and then puts the output back into the clipboard.

## Requirements
- Xclip
- Python 3 (with venv module)

## Installation
Just execute the `install` script - it creates a virtual environment and installs the requirements.

## Usage
Just use the `start` script, it will activate the virtual environment and run the script.
I personally have a hotkey mapped so that a picture (e.g. a Screenshot can be easily processed).
